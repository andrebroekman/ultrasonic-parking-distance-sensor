# ultrasonic-parking-distance-sensor
Static ultrasonic distance measurement device for accurately parking a vehicle in garage. Handy for older vehicles that don't feature parking assist technology. The hardware requirements are kept at a minium, requiring only an Arduino Nano and a low-cost ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04) that can be bought for less than $2USD. A few other components include a potensiometer for setting the exact optimum parking spot when the LED is continiously lit. A DC barrel jack provides the requisite 5-12V power connection for the device (repurposed power supply from a retired Wi-Fi access point.

## Content structure
- Arduino; contains the sketch for the Arduino Nano. Additional information is provided in the sketch on the exact functionality.
- KiCad; basic design file for the circuit layout. The veroboard was simply design "on-the-fly" during construction. I prefer to use terminal blocks and connectors where possible for troubleshooting and ease of assembly.
- media; a couple of photographs as well as a short video clip as viewer from the driver's perspective what the LED response is when parking a vehicle.

## Photos
A couple of pictures of the hardware and installation in the front of the garage, right under the workbench (can be found in the image folder in repository).
